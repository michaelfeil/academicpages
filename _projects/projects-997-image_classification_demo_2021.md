## [An interactive Deep-Learning Demo running MobileNetV2 locally in your Browser](https://michaelfeil.eu/web-tfjs/)

[Website is now live here](https://michaelfeil.eu/web-tfjs/).

This demo was created "just for fun". Protects your pricacy and respects your slow internet connection by loading my Deep-Learning model into your browser and not uploading your images to my server.

Easteregg: Make sure you don't run into the [http error 418]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/418.md %}) ! :-)
This demo is based on a fork from [IBM](https://github.com/IBM/tfjs-web-app).
