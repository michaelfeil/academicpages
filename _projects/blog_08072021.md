# Introduction
This blog post discusses the recent advances in Federated Learning. If your prior knowledge in this field still has a uniform distribution, I can warmly recommend you reading e.g. this CMU blog post by [Tian Li](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2019/11/12/federated-learning-challenges-methods-and-future-directions/) on Federated Learning.

Since the publication of the FedAvg[^s2] paper in 2017..
